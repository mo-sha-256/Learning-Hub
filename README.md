About Me

In the 2003 time frame while working as a server engineer in my first job out of college. I remember when a worm (pretty sure it was slammer) hit our data center and everything slowed to a crawl causing major customer impacts. That's when I developed a passion for infrastructure, IT, and customer service on a path to one day become an infrastructure services delivery hero and leader. I've spent the past 17+ years using that passion to help drive digital transformation in several industries. Some notable key areas include, manufacturing, retail, and financial capabilities.

Throughout my journey, I've helped design, simplify, transform, and innovate strategic infrastructure and application solutions using a customer first philosophy to drive agility, unlock speed, and reduce costs. I do this by keeping the customers interests & needs at the heart of every decision I make, and being their trusted partner and customer advocate. Also, at the same time, finding a balance to make sure it's supportable and efficient for minimal customer interruption.
My background as a Solutions Architect allows me to bring all my experience together to provide options and recommendations for digital transformation utilizing cloud first, hybrid, and cloud agnostic methodologies.

 I love to learn and am always looking for opportunities to add to my knowledge. My progress would not have been possible if I didn't have great partnerships, mentors, and teams of people to help me along the way. I'm a big believer that if you invest in people that you will get that investment back. My lead by example, empathetic, and hard working approach has allowed me to learn a lot about being a leader. It also taught me how to mold people to achieve their goals and become successful, which leads to high performing, engaged, and motivated teams.
